        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="first-li">Ripe, red & juicy tomatoes</li>
          <li>Raw Cashews</li>
          <li>Cream</li>
          <li>Butter &#128514;</li>
          <li>Paneer &#128514;</li>
          <li>Spices & Herbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li class="first-li">
            Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients.
            It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the
            ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled
            ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar &
            pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste.
            Keep aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews
            to a blender or mixer-grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh
            water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the heat to a low or
            medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons (or 3 to 4 tablespoons for a richer
            version) butter in a pan. Either salted or unsalted butter can be
            used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir gently but well. If you haven’t yet, switch off the heat.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's all</p>
